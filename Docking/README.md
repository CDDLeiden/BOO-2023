# Docking of A2B antagonist

## TODO

Create notebook for docking to A2B inactive structure
Subsections:
1. Retrieve structure (from GPCRdb) + prepapre protein (from CBR tutorial 01)
2. Prepare ligand (contact Martin for conformer prediction)
3. Section to dock A2B reference compounds (from CBR tutorial 03)
4. Section to dock selected compounds (from CBR tutorial 03)

Optional things
- Investigate visualization tool > show interactions
- Section on selectivity : docking into A2A (A1 and A3) + superposing structures
